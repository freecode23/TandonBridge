C++ multiple choice question
Assume we have defined a Base class and a Derived class (which derives from Base, obviously)
and the Base class is defined as follows:
Derived class overrides the printData function to look like
(weâ€™re just showing the overridden function, not the rest of the class):

what is the output from the program:
a) Base
b) Derived
c) Base Derived
d) Derived Base
e) None of the above

{

// A non-member function called printIt which looks like:
void printIt(Base *b)
{
    // Base *b = &d
    // b points to a derived object
    // since it's not a virtual function
    // it will print base
    b->printData();
